I’m a Systems Engineer at Oracle, working on the Oracle Linux QA team, where I automate large-scale testing and build AI-powered pipelines to speed up analysis, improve reliability, and ensure compliance across Oracle Linux systems.

Alongside my work, I’m pursuing a PhD in Control Engineering at Hassan II University (ENSEM Casablanca). My research focuses on autonomous UAV control, combining nonlinear control theory, Lyapunov-based stability, and deep reinforcement learning. My aim is developing intelligent flight controllers using the PX4-ROS 2-Gazebo stack in simulation, with plans for real-world testing soon — inshaAllah.

Outside of work and research, I enjoy hiking, swimming, and exploring the beauty of mathematics.

- Role: Systems Engineer, Oracle (Linux QA)
- Research: PhD in Control Engineering — geometric backstepping + learning for UAVs
- Tools: Python/C++, Linux, Docker/Podman, Ansible; PX4 + ROS 2; CV and RL
- Recent: automated OLAM clusters; RAG/MCP pipelines for log triage
