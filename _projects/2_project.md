An AI-assisted pipeline that chunks logs, embeds them, and uses LLM classification with RAG/MCP to surface likely causes and link failures to recent changes.

- Highlights: log chunking, semantic search, failure clustering, auto-summaries
- Stack: Python, LLMs, RAG, MCP, Git/CI

If you want me to add repository links or screenshots, share the URLs and Iâ€™ll add them here.
