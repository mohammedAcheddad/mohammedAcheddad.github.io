This project implements a geometric backstepping controller on SE(3) for quadrotors, producing stable thrust and torque commands and validating performance in PX4 SITL with ROS 2 and Gazebo.

- Highlights: SE(3) control, Lyapunov stability, robust attitude/position tracking
- Stack: PX4 Autopilot, ROS 2, Gazebo, Python/C++

If you want me to link the repo or add plots/videos, tell me the URL and I’ll wire it up here.
